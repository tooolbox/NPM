  description: 'Welcome to the First Vision API documentation. Please note below details for all the APIs: Date fields: All date fields (Request and Response) will be Gregorian -BasicISO (CCYYMMDD) unless mentioned otherwise. Amount Fields: Unless otherwise specified all amount fields are returned in cents or pence or equivalent. The actual decimal point needs to be calculated based on the processing parameter. Number of Decimals used is returned as part of the response. API Request and Response do not display the decimal point unless mentioned in description for field or service. However, the Response provides "number of decimals" as an additional field. For example, "13000" in the Request field is accepted as 130.00. In Response 130.00 will be displayed as 13000 with number of decimal=2.'

      description: 'This service is used to add an account.  The input request will contain selected fields found on the Account Base Segment record.  The service will edit all input data, and populate the Account Base Master file AMBS. If the account number field is not provided on the input message, the number generation service will generate the account number and pass the number back to the Add Account Record service. The service will support the creation of only one Account record per service request.  However, two records with the same number will be created in the local and foreign organizations if the account belongs to a dual currency organization and logo.'

      description: 'This service is used to retrieve data held at the account level for a FirstVision account. This service can be called with an account number or a card number. If an account has been transferred, the current FirstVision account number must be provided, as this service does not automatically switch to the new account. If called with a card number, details will be returned for the account number to which the card number is linked. The service is capable of populating primary card details along with customer details for the customer assigned at the account level. <p>If an account is in a relationship, the account number must be used in the input request and the account’s information will be displayed in the response.<p><p>Additionally, the service is capable of returning details of any insurance products enrolled on the account. As per the current design of the FirstVision system, an account can have maximum 20 active insurance products.<BR/><BR/><p>Fields that are not provided in the Request object will be initialised to their default values.

Instant issuance process is called during card boarding, card action update, lost stolen update.  If the Instant issuance service fails, the card is updated or boarded successfully, but the issuance process is not complete. In such cases, using the Instant Issuance Restart service, by providing the card number and the branch number as input, this service can be called. The service will process only one card at a time and update the account details accordingly. If details on other cards are to be changed because of this card, that will be taken care in the normal batch process. The service will edit all input and also validate the parameter setup for Instant Issuance.  Once the edits are passed it will pass data to the Instant Issuance service. When the service functionality is successfully completed, a response will be returned to the calling program with a Pass return code.  When, the service is not able to successfully complete, the service response will include a Fail return code and any associated error codes indicating that the service was not able to instantly issue the card.<p><p>Any errors returned by the Instant Issuance service will also result in the Restart service failure and the error message from Instant Issuance service will be populated in the response.<BR/><BR/><p>Fields that are not provided in the Request object will be initialised to their default values.

      description: 'The Change Insurance Service allows updates of insurance products for an account. This service will emulate functionality used to update the status of an insurance product for inclusion or exclusion of coverage. A FOREIGN USE indicator will be provided in the input message to allow the requesting source to specify whether the status update applies to the local or foreign account when the account is in a dual currency processing organization. The default will be to the local account.  If the account is in a dual currency, each account must be updated individually.<BR/><BR/><p>Fields that are not provided in the Request object will be initialised to their default values. All numeric fields are initialised to zero and alphanumeric fields initialised to spaces</p>'

The following records are created by this service Plan Segment Data, User Input Data, Amortization Input Data and Commission Subsidy plus the optional Loan Schedule record. Note a Loan Schedule record cannot be provided without a Plan Add record. The service will return a fail indicator F in the response message with an appropriate error code and description for records sent in error. The loan schedule record will be built automatically for ALOP, if Plan number, Term and Principal amount are given.'

      description: 'The purpose of this service is to apply payment and payment reversal transactions immediately to credit card accounts  when it is received as a Faster Payment transaction from the external remitter. The Faster Payment functionality supports duplicate checking for payment transactions. The duplicate payments i.e. same Org, Account and FPS ID, will be rejected and reported. The Faster Payment functionality also supports immediate payment reversals within the same business day. It ensures that payments are only reversed if they have been applied, matching payment transaction with same Org, Account and FPS ID. For successful payment transactions, memo credit will be applied and account Open To Buy ARIQ01 will be increased by that much amount. For successful payment reversal transaction, memo debit will be applied and account OTB ARIQ01 will be decreased by that much amount. The service will return a fail indicator F in the response message with an appropriate error code and description for duplicate payments and non-matching payment reversal transactions. The batch process will extract Faster Payment transactions and post it to CMS accounts.<BR/><BR/><p>Fields that are not provided in the Request object will be initialised to their default values.
